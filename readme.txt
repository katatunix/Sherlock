- Download ADT Bundle for Windows here: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html (I used version adt-bundle-windows-x86-20130917).
- Extract the .zip file downloaded.
- Open Eclipse IDE: eclipse\eclipse.exe.
- Select File/Import/Existing Android Code Into Workspace.
- Note that the "google-play-services_lib" library project must be also imported to workspace.
- Build and run the Sherlock project

If you do not want to build and compile the project, you can use the .apk file which was built already in: _APK\Sherlock.apk
